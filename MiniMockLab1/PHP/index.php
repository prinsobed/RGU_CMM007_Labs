                A software bug is an error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or
                system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to
                behave in unintended ways. Most bugs arise from mistakes and errors made
                by people in either a program's source code or its design, or in frameworks
                and operating systems used by such programs, and a few are caused by compilers
                producing incorrect code. A program that contains a large number of bugs, and/or
                bugs that seriously interfere with its functionality, is said to be buggy or defective.<br><br>

                Reports detailing bugs in a program are commonly known as bug reports,
                defect reports, fault reports, problem reports, trouble reports,
                change requests and so forth.<br><br>

                Bugs trigger errors that may in turn have a wide variety of ripple effects
                with varying levels of inconvenience to the user of the program. Some bugs
                have only a subtle effect on the program's functionality, and may thus lie
                undetected for a long time. More serious bugs may cause the program to crash or freeze.<br><br>

                Others qualify as security bugs and might, for example, enable a malicious user to
                bypass access controls in order to obtain unauthorized privileges.
