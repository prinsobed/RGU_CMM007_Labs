        The history of cheese predates recorded history.
        The origin of cheese is assumed to lie in the practice of
        transporting milk in bladders made of ruminants' stomachs,
        with their inherent supply of rennet. There is no conclusive
        evidence indicating where cheese-making originated, either in:
            <ul type="square">
                <li>Europe,</li>
                <li>Central Asia,</li>
                <li>the Middle East,</li>
                <li>or Sahara.</li>
            </ul>
        Cheese-making had spread within Europe at the earliest level of
        Hellenic myth and, according to Pliny the Elder, had become a
        sophisticated enterprise by the time ancient Rome came into being,
        when valued foreign cheeses were transported to Rome to satisfy
        the tastes of the social elite.

        Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature [Wiki].
