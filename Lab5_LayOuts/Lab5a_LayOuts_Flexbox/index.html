        <p>Red is the color at the end of the spectrum of visible light next to orange and opposite violet.
            Red color has a predominant light wavelength of roughly 620–740 nanometres.
            Red is one of the additive primary colors of visible light, along with green and blue,
            which in Red Green Blue (RGB) color systems are combined to create all the colors on a computer
            monitor or television screen. Red is also one of the subtractive primary colors, along with yellow
            and blue, of the RYB color space and traditional color wheel used by painters and artists [Wiki].</p>

        <p>White is an achromatic color, literally a "color without hue", that is a mixture of the frequencies
            of all the colors of the visible spectrum. It is one of the most common colors in nature, the color
            of sunlight, snow, milk, chalk, limestone and other common minerals. In many cultures white represents
            or signifies purity, innocence, and light, and is the symbolic opposite of black, or darkness.
            According to surveys in Europe and the United States, white is the color most often associated with perfection,
            the good, honesty, cleanliness, the beginning, the new, neutrality, and exactitude [Wiki].</p>

        <p>Green is the color between blue and yellow on the spectrum of visible light. It is evoked by light with a
            predominant wavelength of roughly 495–570 nm. In the subtractive color system, used in painting and color printing,
            it is created by a combination of yellow and blue, or yellow and cyan; in the RGB color model, used on television
            and computer screens, it is one of the additive primary colors, along with red and blue,
            which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors [Wiki].</p>
