        <h1>Welcome to the School of Computing Science and Digital Media</h1>

        <p>The School of Computing Science and Digital Media courses develop skills and
            expertise for a wide range of Computing technologies and target applications.
            The School has an excellent reputation for its innovative and practical
            approaches to teaching and learning. For generations it has produced qualified
            professionals across a broad spectrum of technical careers with graduates in
            high profile, international roles. Our applied approach to the subject ensures
            our graduate employment rate remains one of the best in the UK. We have recently
            been recognised as the best new university in the UK for computing
            (Times Good University Guide 2009 and 2010).
        </p>
